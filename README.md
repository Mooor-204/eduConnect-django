# EduConnect - University Admission System

EduConnect is a comprehensive system that allows students to discover and apply to universities based on their education system and academic performance. The system will store information about various universities, their programs, requirements, and deadlines. The system will also allow students to search for universities by entering the education system they studied. If there are any universities available, they will be displayed. Students can then submit their applications.
